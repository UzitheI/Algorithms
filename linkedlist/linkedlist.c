//this is an example of a linked list

//the properties of linked list are:
/*
the consecutive node are not stored consecutively in the memory location and can be scattered
there is no need to shift the nodes in a linked list when addition or deletion 
the memory of a single node can be allocated dynamically
a singly linkedlist has a single pointer for the next node and a doubly linked list has 2 pointers for previous and next node

the properties of linked list are:
creation:the operation is used to create a linked list
insertion/deletion
traversing
searching
concatenation=done for joining the first linked list to another linked list
